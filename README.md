# QUAKE3_TENSOR_TRIGGER
A machine learning trigger bot for Quake III Arena &amp; Quake Live.

### All you have to do is force player models to the aqua blue bones model as that is the only character model I trained this dataset on.

### prerequisites 
```
sudo apt install clang xterm python3 python3-pip libx11-dev libxdo-dev libxdo3 libespeak1 libespeak-dev espeak
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3 -m pip install numpy
sudo python3 -m pip install tensorflow-cpu
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow-cpu
sudo python3 -m pip install tf2onnx
sudo python3 -m pip install onnxruntime
```

### exec
```
./RUN.sh
```

This is cool but [this one is simpler and better](https://gist.github.com/mrbid/37996a90792f26bd02787fd4ab8b1bad).
